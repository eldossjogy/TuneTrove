## About 
TuneTrove is a website for rating albums, similar to rateyourmusic.com, but with a twist - users can rate albums without seeing others' ratings, ensuring unbiased feedback. This project serves as a learning experience to explore the advantages and disadvantages of using Supabase and TypeScript in web development.
